### ðŸ’¼ My Journey

At IBM, I contributed to the development of MaaS360, an AI-powered Unified Endpoint Management platform. My responsibilities included backend development, feature enhancements, and serving as a Scrum Master. This experience helped sharpen my skills in problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and agile project execution.

Since beginning my graduate studies, I have worked on multiple analytics engagements through the Carlson Analytics Lab. These include projects in enrollment optimization, policy impact evaluation (NIL in NCAA), ESG fraud detection, and warehouse location planning for a nonprofit food hub. Each project was rooted in real business contexts, requiring both analytical rigor and practical communication.
